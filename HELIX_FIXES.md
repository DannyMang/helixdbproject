# Helix DB Local Development Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SSL Certificate Issues
**Problem**: Caddy was trying to obtain SSL certificates for production domains (`letta.wache.dev`, `toph.wache.dev`) which were failing in local development.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `.env` to use localhost domains
- Modified `Caddyfile` to use port-based routing instead of domain-based routing
- Configured Caddy to proxy local ports without SSL

### 2. Helix Build Configuration
**Problem**: The Helix container was experiencing "unexpected EOF" errors during build, likely due to:
- Network timeouts during Rust/Helix installation
- Missing error handling in build process
- Build context issues

**Fix**:
- Added retry logic for Helix installation
- Improved Rust installation with stable toolchain
- Added timeout and error handling for `helix install`
- Added verification steps in Dockerfile

### 3. Container Startup Issues
**Problem**: The start script wasn't handling errors properly and containers were failing silently.

**Fix**:
- Added proper error handling in `start.sh`
- Added configuration validation
- Improved logging and error messages
- Added health checks

### 4. Network Configuration
**Problem**: Services weren't properly connected and ports weren't configured for local development.

**Fix**:
- Updated docker-compose.yml with proper port mappings
- Added dependencies between services
- Configured Caddy to proxy all services

## Local Development Setup

### Environment Configuration
The `.env` file has been updated for local development:
```
DOMAIN=localhost:8080
DB_DOMAIN=localhost:6969
LETTA_DOMAIN=localhost:8283
```

### Service Access
After successful startup, you can access:
- **Main FastAPI app**: http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:8080
- **Helix DB**: http://localhost:6969
- **Letta**: http://localhost:8283

### Docker Compose Updates
- Added proper port mappings for all services
- Fixed Caddy configuration for local development
- Added health checks and dependencies

## Running the Fixed Configuration

1. **Start Docker Desktop** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   open -a "Docker Desktop"
   ```

2. **Stop existing containers** (if any):
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Clean build and start**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f helix
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If Helix still fails to build:
1. Check Docker has enough memory allocated (8GB recommended)
2. Ensure stable internet connection for downloading dependencies
3. Try building just the Helix service: `docker compose build helix`

### If services can't connect:
1. Verify all containers are running: `docker compose ps`
2. Check network connectivity: `docker compose logs caddy`
3. Test individual service health endpoints

### If ports are already in use:
Update the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` to use different host ports.

## Key Changes Made

1. **`.env`**: Updated domains for local development
2. **`Caddyfile`**: Changed from domain-based to port-based routing
3. **`helix/Dockerfile`**: Added error handling and retry logic
4. **`helix/start.sh`**: Improved error handling and validation
5. **`docker-compose.yml`**: Added port mappings and dependencies

These fixes should resolve the "unexpected EOF" and SSL certificate issues you were experiencing.
